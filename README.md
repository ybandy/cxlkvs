# SSD-Based Key-Value Stores on Microsecond-Latency CXL Memory

We study the possibility of displacing most of in-memory data structures of SSD-based KV stores
from the host DRAM to CXL memory with microsecond-level latency, and still achieving competitive KV throughputs.

This repository contains code to evaluate the following three pieces of software.
* Microbenchmark
* [Modified Aerospike](https://github.com/ybandy/aerospike-server)
* [Modified CacheLib](https://github.com/ybandy/CacheLib)

## Hardware Requirements

The code assumes that
* Long latency memory is exposed as separate NUMA nodes from the host DRAM
* Latency of the memory can be adjusted

The computational environment we tested is as follows.
We use CXL-enabled CPUs and FPGAs, and the FPGAs work as CXL memory with adjustable latency.
